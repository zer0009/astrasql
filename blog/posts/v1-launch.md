## We're Live! 🚀

We're thrilled to announce the beta launch of **AstraSQL Agent v0.0.1**! After months of development and testing, we're ready to help teams unlock the power of their data through natural language. This beta release represents our commitment to privacy-first, self-hosted data access.

## What is AstraSQL Agent?

AstraSQL Agent is an AI-powered tool that converts natural language questions into SQL queries. But unlike other tools, we've built it with **privacy-first principles** - the AI only sees your database schema (table and column names), never your actual data.

### Key Features

✅ **Natural Language to SQL** - Ask questions in plain English  
✅ **Metadata-Only AI** - Your data never leaves your database  
✅ **Multi-Database Support** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB  
✅ **Multiple LLM Providers** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, Ollama  
✅ **Interactive Dashboards** - Visualize your data with beautiful charts  
✅ **Enterprise Security** - Role-based access, audit logs, compliance-ready  
✅ **Self-Hosted** - Deploy on your infrastructure, maintain full control  

## Why We Built AstraSQL

### The Problem

We've seen too many teams struggle with data access:
- **Non-technical team members** can't query databases
- **SQL knowledge** is a barrier to insights
- **Privacy concerns** prevent using AI-powered tools
- **Complex queries** take too long to write
- **Data silos** prevent collaboration

### Our Solution

AstraSQL makes data accessible to everyone while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security. Whether you're a product manager exploring metrics, a sales team analyzing performance, or an executive making data-driven decisions, AstraSQL empowers you to get answers instantly.
